# FileSearcher

This project is basically finished, it didn't become what I had imagined it to be.

It's a simple file searcher where you pick a directory and it will list all files or folders that match the criteria you define.

I'm not going to make releases so if you want to try it out do ```git clone``` and a ```./gradlew run```.

I didn't add the plugin to build this into a nice application but if you wanted to I would use the badass jlink plugin.
